So, this is my web presentation for my old middle school's career day, in which I will talk about what it's like to switch careers (and pretend that I have successfully done so already).

It uses the scrollTo() JQuery plugin, as well as the Less CSS framework, and I am praying to Google that the school has a browser other than IE on their computers...but the styling should work nonetheless. It uses an Apple-like black linen for it's main background, because it makes it really easy to look like I know what I'm doing in a really short amount of time. At least to a bunch of 8th graders.
