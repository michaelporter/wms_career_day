	//So here's what I do: make a big ol' list, float 'em, and leave some of them blank, but all are the same size; 
	//Set up a path of links so that none crosses another's path, but also make it clear that things are indeed moving;
	// this might require a little bit of texture; perhaps some kind of patchwork would be nice.

	// set each to the width of the screen!!  $(obj).css('width', $(window).width); I think!

	// between some of the boxes are transition boxes, with transition designs...arrows and such


	// Items:
		Started on the spotlight at WMS
		Acted in HS, at Fenwick
		Went into lighting design at Bard, ran the student theater
		Studied Lit, but couldn't stop finding new hobbies, even when writing senior project
		Did some freelance Lighting design(Lighting design pictures, for sure)
		Programming and electronics became a huge fascination for me in college
		Went to Steppenwolf, wasn't happy with the career opportunities ahead of me
		Now pursuing a career in web development, self-teaching, and teaching lessons on the side

		ACTUALLY: Probably better to just talk about the lighting and career transfer, and then move to this for the
		strictly web dev part
